# Principal-Component-Analysis
Implementation of dimensionality reduction algorithms: Linear PCA, Probabilistic PCA, Kernel PCA.


| Principal component analysis, (PCA) is probably the oldest and best known of the techniques of Multivariate Analysis.
The central idea of principal component analysis is to reduce the dimensionality of a data set in which there
are a large number of interrelated variables, while retaining as much as possible of the variation present
in the data set. This reduction is achieved by transforming to a new set of variables, the Principal
Components, which are uncorrelated, and which are ordered so that the first few retain most of the
variation present in all of the original variables.

| Probabilistic PCA:
PCA can also be expressed as the Maximum Likelihood solution of a Probabilistic latent variable model. This 
reformulation of PCA, known as Probabilistic PCA, brings several advantages compared with conventional
PCA.

|  Kernel PCA:
Kernel principal component analysis is an extension of principal component analysis (PCA) using techniques of kernel methods.
When this technique of kernel substitution is applied to principal component analysis,
we obtain a nonlinear generalization of the method.
